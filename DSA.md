1. Breadth First Search - Data Structure to implement it (Queue). Need to understand it to the level where you can code on it. Example -

Q2: Implement def shortestPath(fromStationName, toStationName) method to find shortest
path between 2 stations
/*

*/
Used BFS approach to get the solution and asked why BFS.
The code was working for all the scenarios.





   
3. Depth First Search - Data Structure to implement it (Stack)
4. HashMap - Internals, Why HashMap is able to achive O(1) time complexity for both get and put operations ? In what scenario do you think the time complexity would decrease to O(n) time complexity ? What improvements have been done in java8 to fix this ? What is loadFactor in HashMap and how it is used ?
5. LinkedHashMap - use case where we can use it. Example - LRU Cache
6. Internal Implementation of TreeMap - RedBlackTree. Understand at high level how red black tree corresponds to balanced binary search tree
7. What is binary search tree ? What would be the time complexity of searching an element in binary serach Tree ?
8. ConcurrentHashMap - where would you use it ? Able to explain internal implementation
9. HashMap vs HashTable
10. LinkedHashMap - use where we can use it
11. Synchronized HashMap vs Concurrent HashMap ?
12. What happen if we add duplicate key, value records into concurrent HashMap ?
13. Binary Search Questions Can be tricky. Need to see how to use it. Example usage - Find first and last positions of an element in a sorted array - https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/find-first-and-last-positions-of-an-element-in-a-sorted-array/
14. Question on equals() and hashcode() contract
Can we override only hashcode and if yes then what will be the effect
15. BinaryTree - InOrder, PreOrder, PostOrder traversals

16. what is priorityqueue
	d. what is min heap
	e. how to implement min heap without priorityqueue.
	f. what is the tree structure of heap.
	g. How to create tree.
	f. how to create tree without Node.


Can we use Employee object as Key of Hashmap. If so how

Difference between LinkedHashMap and HashMap. Internal working


9. concurrenthashmap

10. print a hashMap in sorted order of keys
