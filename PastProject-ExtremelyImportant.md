Project Architecture

In Project what are moduled you have worked and explain me the the chalenges you faced.

Asked to draw a architecture for a project (lets say given 3 microservices and a UI component). What components you will have?

How do you optimise project from non-functions requirement.

They asked questions related to project and which is mentioned in my resume,
 like you have mentioned multithreading can you give me scenario how you have used in your project

 The discussion was primarily centered on my past experiences and projects, with both interviewers delving deeply into my contributions. The focus areas included the design, architecture, security (both service and application level), and the performance of the services I had worked on.

I was asked numerous questions about AWS, covering topics such as infrastructure, VPC, IAM roles, best practices, and trade-offs involved in decision-making.

There was also a significant emphasis on API performance, including monitoring, best practices, and debugging in production environments. This included discussions on tools and techniques like thread dumps, VisualVM, and JProfiler.
